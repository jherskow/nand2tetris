/**
 * The SquareDance class implements the Square Dance game.
 * In this game you can move a black square around the screen and
 * change its size during the movement.
 * In the beggining, the square is located at the top left corner.
 * Use the arrow keys to move the square.
 * Use 'z' & 'x' to decrement & increment the size.
 * Use 'q' to quit.
